# Hi there, I'm definitelynotDD! 👋

> _"Coding, clouding, and always blocking my own chain of procrastination."_ 😄

I'm a BTech student majoring in Computer Science & Engineering, passionate about turning ideas into code (and sometimes into working prototypes!).  
From Python automation scripts to AI models and even dabbling in blockchain, I love exploring the tech universe.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript
- **Web Dev:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a sprinkle of frameworks
- **AI/ML:** Always experimenting with new models
- **Cloud:** Deploying dreams, one VM at a time
- **Blockchain:** Currently learning how to not lose my crypto

## 🚀 Favorite Project
### [PDF Toolkit](#)
Built during my internship, PDF Toolkit is my go-to project for all things PDF – mergers, splitters, compressors, converters... you name it!  
_Sadly, it can't turn my assignments in on time (yet)._

## ⚽ Fun Facts
- You'll find me on the football field when I'm not debugging.
- I love reading short novels – it's the only time I finish something in one sitting!
